**Slapstick Traps** is a rage game, which illustrates my experience with learning **Unreal Engine 5** so far - there has been bear traps at every corner. The key is to learn from mistakes and try to not repeat them, you should get better the more you practice. Your failures might make you swear, but others laugh. It's meant to be more fun to watch than play.

This game was made during **GGJ 2024**, which theme was "Make Me Laugh".
